## Assignment 1 - Interplanetary Mission
The Polimi Space Agency is carrying out a feasibility study for an Interplanetary Explorer Mission in the Solar System. The starting planet is Mars, while the target one is Venus. The transfer will be based on the patched conics method with a powered Fly-By around Earth. The figure of merit assessed to choose the best transfer option is the total cost in terms of Delta V. The mission is required to have as earliest departure date December 1st 2027 and latest arrival date December 1st 2067.

## Assignment 2 - Planetary Mission
The Polimi Space Agency wants to launch a new Planetary Explorer Mission around the Earth. To perform a correct observation different types of methods will be evaluated. Specifically, starting from the unperturbed situation, the J2 effect and the lunar gravity perturbation will be taken into account to describe how the orbit and the related ground track vary over different lapses of time. Gauss and Cartesian numerical integration methods will be used to assess the Keplerian elements variation which will be also filtered to highlight the results obtained. Finally, to validate the model created, an already in-orbit satellite will be appraised.
